# VTA: Versatile Tensor Accelerator

The Versatile Tensor Accelerator (VTA) is an open, generic, and customizable deep learning accelerator with a complete TVM-based compiler stack. We designed VTA to expose the most salient and common characteristics of mainstream deep learning accelerators. Together TVM and VTA form an end-to-end hardware-software deep learning system stack that includes hardware design, drivers, a JIT runtime, and an optimizing compiler stack based on TVM.
